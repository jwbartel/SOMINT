Toolkit for making predictions about sharing. Developed by Jacob Bartel

# Quick Start with Eclipse

The following is a guide to getting up an running as quickly as possible. The only assumption this quick start guide
makes is that you have Eclipse installed.

## Step 1: Get Maven

Download Maven from http://maven.apache.org, extract it, and add the binaries folder to your system path. Make sure the
`JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.

## Step 2: Setup Eclipse with Maven

From the **Help** menu select **Eclipse Marketplace**.

Install the plugin called *Maven Integration for Eclipse*. This will require Eclipse to restart.

After restarting, go to **Window->Preferences** in Eclipse, and then go to **Maven->Installations**.  Add the install of Maven from Step 1.

## Step 3: Get and Initialize the Repository

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/jwbartel/SharingPredictor.git
```

From a command line (if using Windows, use command prompt not powershell), navigate to the folder you just cloned and
run the following command.

```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=oeall17.jar -DgroupId=edu.unc -DartifactId=oeall -Dversion=17 -Dpackaging=jar
```

## Step 4: Add the Project to Eclipse

In Eclipse, import a Maven project. Select the project you just cloned.

*Note:* The compliance level may be set to **1.5** so be sure to change this to **1.7**.

## Step 5: Use the Toolkit

That's it, you're all set up. You may now use the toolkit to generate predictions
